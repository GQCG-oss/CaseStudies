# Case Study 1: Equation of State of the Lennard-Jones Fluid - I

One important application of molecular simulation is computing the phase diagram of a given model system. In several chapters, we discuss some of the techniques that have been developed to study phase transitions, in- cluding direct-coexistence simulations. However, direct-coexistence simu- lations may suffer from hysteresis, which may make them less suited for locating phase transitions. In the present Case Study, we illustrate some of the problems that occur when we use standard Monte Carlo simulation to determine a phase diagram.
